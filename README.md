#Carbon-Offset-Marketplace-using-NFTs

Climate change demands urgent action, and carbon offsetting—where entities that reduce or remove emissions earn tradable carbon credits—has emerged as a key strategy. However, the current market suffers from inefficiencies, fraud, and lack of transparency due to centralized systems. This project introduces a decentralized solution using blockchain and NFTs on Ethereum to represent carbon credits, ensuring secure ownership, verifiable tracking, and smart contract-based authenticity. A modern web interface and backend enhance usability, aiming to build a scalable, transparent, and trustworthy carbon credit market aligned with global sustainability goals.
